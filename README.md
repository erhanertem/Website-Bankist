## Udemy The Complete JavaScript Course 2022 From Zero to Expert! by Jonas Schmedtmann

### **Objective:** Create a landing web page for a fictitious Bank called 'Bankist'

<p>

- Explore advanced DOM Events

  - Make multiple instances of an event listener
    - via queryselectorAll() nodelist and forEach() method
    - via event delegation, closest()
  - Create smooth scrolling link
    - Old school: getBoundingClientRect(), scrollTo(), window.scrollX/scrollY
    - Modern Implementation: scrollIntoView()
  - Create a sticky nav bar (single entry), reveal elements on scroll (multiple entries), lazyloading images (multiple entries with custom attribute transpose) via Intersection Observer API
  - Create full-fletched slider with arrow key, nav btns and dot btns navigations mediums
    - Created a JS+HTML hybrid slider with rollback-to-start transition as originally instructed in this tutorial
    - Aside the tutorial, provided 2nd solution: my own JS only solution which implements continuous img loop either direction
    - Aside the tutorial, provided 3rd solution: JS and HTML hybrid solution which implements continous loop either direction (Required CSS changes, addEventListener "transitionend" DOM event plays a crucial role in continous loop implementation)
